I remember when we broke up the first time
saying:'this is it, i've had enough' cause like
We have'nt seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
WHAT?

Then you come around again and say:'Baby I miss you & I swear I'm gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say:'I hate you' We break up, you call me I love you

Ooooooh We called it of again last night but...
Ooooooh This time I'm telling you I'm telling you...

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
would hide a way and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine...

Ooooooh You called it of again last night but...
Ooooooh This time I'm telling you I'm telling you...

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
